Task:
Write a function that receives two sequences: A and B of integers and returns one sequence C. Sequence C should contain all elements from sequence A (maintaining the order) except those, that are present in sequence B p times, where p is a prime number.

Example:
A=[2,3,9,2,5,1,3,7,10]
B=[2,1,3,4,3,10,6,6,1,7,10,10,10]
C=[2,9,2,5,7,10]


The result of my program:

First
  The execution time of the algorithm: 0.00006910 seconds 
  2, 9, 2, 5, 7, 10
  
 Second
  The execution time of the algorithm: 0.00007120 seconds 
  2, 9, 2, 5, 7, 10
  
 Third
   The execution time of the algorithm: 0.00006840 seconds 
   2, 9, 2, 5, 7, 10
